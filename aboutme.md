My name is Yuan-Ting Hsieh, from Taiwan. I am a master student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, major in Computer Sciences.
Currently doing a summer internship at [JD AI Research](http://air.jd.com/) in Mountain View, working on Natural Language Processing tasks.

I am interested in machine learning and its related applications.
Before this, I've spent 1.5 years at [Speech Processing Laboratory](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) working on key-term extraction problem,
under the supervision of Prof. [Lin-Shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/).
I've also joined [Vision & Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/) focusing on domain adaptation,
under Dr. [Yu-Chiang (Frank) Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html).

I am also excited about building cool projects.
Like this [boxing game](https://github.com/YuanTingHsieh/RealSteelBoxingGame),
we use the Raspberry Pi boards with MPU-6050 chips to sense the motion of users so they can fight each other with our gloves!
You can check this fun demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziXI6g9NkU&feature=youtu.be).
